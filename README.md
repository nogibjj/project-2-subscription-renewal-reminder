# IDS 721 Project 2: Kubernetes based Continuous Delivery - Subscription Renewal Reminder

Do you hate that your subscription auto-renewed but you can do nothing because you forget to cancel it? Here is a microservice to remind you of your subscription renewal and urge you to cancel it if you want.

## Goals:
* Create a customized Docker container from the current version of Python that deploys a simple python script.
* Push image to DockerHub, or Cloud based Container Registery (ECR)
* Project should deploy automatically to Kubernetes cluster
* Deployment should be to some form of Kubernetes service (can be hosted like Google Cloud Run or Amazon EKS, etc)

## Steps:
* GET, POST, PUT APIs.
* Twilio API - This API provides communication services, including SMS, voice, and video. It can send text messages, make phone calls, or even build a full-featured video chat app. The API is easy to use and has a free plan that allows you to try out the service.
